Install prerequisites and add the platform:

```bash
dotnet workload install android
carbon platform add android
```

Configure SDK levels and identity under `bundle.android`:

```json
{
  "bundle": {
    "android": {
      "package": "dev.example.app",
      "minSdk": 24,
      "targetSdk": 34,
      "compileSdk": 34
    }
  }
}
```

Device permissions in `permissions` are translated into AndroidManifest entries during platform sync.

Run on a connected device or emulator:

```bash
carbon dev android
```

Create an installable APK or Play Store AAB:

```bash
carbon bundle android
carbon bundle android --aab
```

Release signing uses the configured keystore and environment variables described in
[Signing & notarization](/distribute/signing/).
