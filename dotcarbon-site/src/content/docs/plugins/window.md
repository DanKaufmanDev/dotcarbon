description: Create and control labeled desktop windows from TypeScript.

```bash
carbon add plugin Window
```

```ts
import { WebviewWindow } from '@dotcarbon/plugin-window'

const window = await WebviewWindow.create({
  label: 'settings',
  title: 'Settings',
  url: 'settings.html',
  width: 720,
  height: 520,
  capabilities: ['settings'],
})

await window.center()
await window.setAlwaysOnTop(true)
const state = await window.getState()
```

Static methods include `create`, `getCurrent`, `getByLabel`, and `getAll`. Window handles expose state,
title, size, position, center, minimize, maximize, unmaximize, fullscreen, always-on-top, resizable,
and close operations.

Commands default to the calling window when no label is supplied. Capability checks still use the
originating webview, so creating a privileged window does not grant its permissions to the caller.
